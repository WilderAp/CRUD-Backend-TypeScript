Hello there!

Welcome to this CRUD app developed by WilderAp to practice coding
This is the Backend side of the application, so if you want to test the full app, you must also download/clone the frontend part of the application!
This Server was made using Expressjs with TypeScript

You must clone it and execute the "npm install" command to be able to turn on the server.
Also to start the server you can use the "npm run start" command on the main root terminal.
